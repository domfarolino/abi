# Learning about ABI stability and dynamic linking

This repository hosts a few examples of programs that take advantage of static linking and
dynamically linked shared libraries, all in service of helping describe:

 - What an ABI is
 - How it differs from an API
 - What ABI stability is and when/why it matters

This is all meant to supplement a blog post that doesn't yet exist.
